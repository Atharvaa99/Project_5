# Cinema Room Manager (Kotlin)

This is a Kotlin project I built to simulate a cinema booking system through the command line. The program allows users to view available seats, book tickets, and track sales statistics in real-time.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

Cinema has always been a fascinating part of the entertainment world. With this project, I wanted to explore how backend systems power real-world applications like ticket booking and inventory tracking.

It also helped me improve logic building and user input handling using Kotlin, while working with nested loops, conditionals, and clean formatting.
